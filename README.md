# RustFileMaster ðŸ“„

**RustFileMaster** is a Rust library designed to simplify and optimize file and filesystem manipulation. It offers advanced features such as compression, encryption, and metadata management, while being performant and secure.

## Key Features

### ðŸ“„ File Manipulation

- **Creation, Reading, Writing, Deletion**: Basic functions to create, read, write, and delete files.
- **Copying and Moving**: Functions to copy and move files and directories.
- **Permissions**: Manage file permissions (read, write, execute).

### ðŸ“„ Compression

- **Supported Formats**: Support for common compression formats like ZIP, GZIP, and TAR.
- **Compression and Decompression**: Functions to compress and decompress files and directories.
- **Incremental Compression**: Support for incremental compression to minimize disk space usage.

### ðŸ“„ Encryption

- **Supported Algorithms**: Support for common encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, and ChaCha20.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Functions to encrypt and decrypt files.
- **Key Management**: Tools to securely generate, store, and manage encryption keys.

### ðŸ“„ Metadata Management

- **Reading and Writing**: Functions to read and write file metadata (author, creation date, etc.).
- **Supported Formats**: Support for common metadata formats like EXIF, ID3, and XMP.
- **Indexing**: Tools to index metadata for easier file search and retrieval.

### ðŸ“„ Performance and Security

- **Optimization**: Use of optimization techniques to improve file operation performance.
- **Security**: Implementation of best security practices to protect files from unauthorized access.

## Architecture

### Modules

- **file_ops**: Module for basic file operations.
- **compression**: Module for compression and decompression functionalities.
- **encryption**: Module for encryption and decryption functionalities.
- **metadata**: Module for metadata management.
- **utils**: Module for utilities and helper functions.

## Dependencies

- **serde**: For serialization and deserialization of metadata.
- **flate2**: For GZIP compression and decompression.
- **zip**: For ZIP file management.
- **aes**: For AES encryption.
- **rsa**: For RSA encryption.

## Usage Examples

```rust
use rust_file_master::file_ops;
use rust_file_master::compression;
use rust_file_master::encryption;
use rust_file_master::metadata;

fn main() {
    // Create a file
    file_ops::create_file("example.txt").expect("Failed to create file");

    // Write to a file
    file_ops::write_file("example.txt", "Hello, world!").expect("Failed to write to file");

    // Read a file
    let content = file_ops::read_file("example.txt").expect("Failed to read file");
    println!("File content: {}", content);

    // Compress a file
    compression::compress_file("example.txt", "example.zip").expect("Failed to compress file");

    // Decompress a file
    compression::decompress_file("example.zip", "example_decompressed.txt").expect("Failed to decompress file");

    // Encrypt a file
    let key = encryption::generate_key();
    encryption::encrypt_file("example.txt", "example.enc", &key).expect("Failed to encrypt file");

    // Decrypt a file
    encryption::decrypt_file("example.enc", "example_decrypted.txt", &key).expect("Failed to decrypt file");

    // Read file metadata
    let metadata = metadata::read_metadata("example.txt").expect("Failed to read metadata");
    println!("File metadata: {:?}", metadata);

    // Write file metadata
    metadata::write_metadata("example.txt", metadata).expect("Failed to write metadata");
}
```
